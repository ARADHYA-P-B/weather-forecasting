Real-Time Weather Monitoring System with Rollups and  Aggregates

Overview:- 

This project is a Real-Time Data Processing System designed to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights such as rollups and aggregates. The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays real-time information on various weather metrics like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. Additionally, it processes the data to provide summary statistics like average temperature, humidity over time, and more.

Features:- 

Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches and displays live weather conditions from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Rollups and Aggregates: Processes real-time data to calculate metrics such as:
     1.Average Temperature
     2.Maximum Wind Speed
     3.Minimum Humidity
     4.Daily summaries
Interactive UI: User-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Data Visualization: Charts and graphs for better representation of weather trends.
Auto Refresh: Fetches new weather data at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

Tech Stack:-
 -Frontend:
  .HTML
  .CSS
  .JavaScript (Vanilla)
Fetch API (for calling the OpenWeatherMap API)
Chart.js (optional, for data visualization)

ExternalAPI:-  OpenWeatherMap API for fetching real-time weather data.
